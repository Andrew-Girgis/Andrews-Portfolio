<h3>Abstract</h3>

<hr>
This paper examines potential predictors for stock market returns on
Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) startup companies. Employing a GARCH
model, which is widely used in financial econometrics for forecasting
volatility in time series data, we aim to capture the dynamic nature of
volatility in stock returns. Additionally, a Vector Autoregression (VAR)
model is utilized to predict future stock returns. Evaluation of model
accuracy is conducted using mean absolute percent error. Throughout the
paper we identify optimal forecasting models, perform forecasts of the
volatility and stock market returns, and assess the errors of the
forecasts. Results indicate inadequacy in accurately predicting future
volatility and returns using the predictors proposed in this paper.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
<p>The literature on predicting market returns and volatility
encompasses various methodologies and findings, providing valuable
insights into the dynamics of financial markets. Shen et al. (2021)
employ tGARCH and VAR models to forecast future market returns and
volatility in their study titled "Predicting stock and bond market
returns with emotions: Evidence from futures markets" <span
class="citation" data-cites="Shen_Griffith_Najand_Sun_2021"></span>.
Utilizing a VAR(5) model with a lag of five days for the business week,
they identify a single predictor among five initially considered
variables that significantly influences future market returns. In a
similar vein, Li and Sun (2023) explore the predictive power of credit
risk on Chinese stock market returns in their paper "Predicting stock
market returns using aggregate credit risk" <span class="citation"
data-cites="Li_Sun_2023"></span>. Employing regression and VAR(1)
models, they find that their models perform well in short-range
forecasts but exhibit diminished accuracy over longer forecast horizons.
This underscores the importance of considering the forecast window
duration when developing predictive models for market returns. Cai and
Stander (2019) delve into the estimation and density forecasting of
financial returns using the threshold GARCH model in their research
<span class="citation" data-cites="Cai_Stander_2019"></span>. They
highlight the limitations of the traditional GARCH(1,1) model,
particularly its failure to capture the stylized fact that conditional
variance tends to increase after a decrease in returns compared to an
increase. Despite testing various GARCH models, including GARCH(3,2) and
GJR-GARCH(2,1,2), they find that the GARCH(1,1) model exhibits superior
out-of-sample predictive power. In contrast, Hansen and Lunde (2001)
focus on comparing volatility models in their paper "A forecast
comparison of volatility models: Does anything beat a GARCH(1,1)?" <span
class="citation" data-cites="Hansen_Lunde_2001"></span>. While they find
no evidence that the GARCH(1,1) model is outperformed by other GARCH or
ARCH models with respect to exchange rate data, they observe marginally
better performance in predicting stock returns, albeit with limited data
from IBM stock returns. Notably, they emphasize the necessity of
accounting for leverage effects to achieve robust out-of-sample
performance.</p>
<p>Building upon this literature, the present study aims to forecast the
volatility and returns of Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) startup company
stocks by leveraging complementary and substitutionary goods and
commodities. Through the application of GARCH and VAR models, we seek to
identify optimal modeling approaches and evaluate their forecasting
performance using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). By
examining the interplay between BEV stock returns and external factors,
this research contributes to our understanding of market dynamics and
informs decision-making in investment and risk management
strategies.</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces
the basic model framework. In section 3, we introduce the data used for
the analysis and look into the methodology. Section 4 provides empirical
applications. Section 5 concludes. All the proofs are provided in
Appendix A and some tables and figures are collected in Appendix
B.<br />

Model and Its Statistical Properties</h1>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{eq:garch_model}
\sigma^2_t = \omega + \alpha_1\epsilon^2_{t-1} + \beta_1\sigma^2_{t-1} +
\gamma X_{t-1}\]</span></p>
<p>In my research, I employ a variant of the Generalized Autoregressive
Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, specifically the
GARCH(1,1) model with an external regressor. This model is used to
estimate the conditional variance of the returns of a stock, which helps
in understanding the volatility dynamics of the stock market. Breaking
down the components of the model shown in equation <a
href="#eq:garch_model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:garch_model">[eq:garch_model]</a>, conditional
variance (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_t^2\)</span>) term
represents the variance of the stock returns at time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, given the information available up to
time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. In other words, it captures
the volatility of the stock returns. Intercept (<span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>), this is the constant term in the
variance equation representing the baseline level of volatility. ARCH
Effect (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span>) parameter
captures the impact of past squared errors (residuals) on the current
conditional variance. It signifies the autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity (ARCH) effect, where past shocks to the system affect
the current volatility. GARCH Effect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>) parameter measures the impact of
past conditional variances on the current variance. It represents the
volatility persistence in the stock returns, indicating whether
volatility tends to persist over time. External Regressor (<span
class="math inline">\(X_{t-1}\)</span>) term introduces an external
variable into the model, namely the lagged returns of another stock. By
including this regressor, we aim to capture any additional explanatory
power that the lagged returns of another stock may have on the
volatility of the current stock returns. Overall, the GARCH(1,1) model
with an external regressor allows me to model the conditional variance
of stock returns, taking into account both past volatility and the
influence of an external variable. This provides valuable insights into
the volatility dynamics of the stock market, which is essential for risk
management and investment decision-making.</p>

<p>Vector Autoregression (VAR) 1 Model for Stock Returns In the context
of financial markets, particularly the stock market, the VAR model
serves as an instrument for understanding the interdependencies among
various assets and their external drivers. In this study, we employ a
VAR model to investigate the behavior of stock returns, considering the
influence of three external regressors: returns of Gasoline, Lithium
Battery, and Chargepoint stocks. The VAR model proposed in equation <a
href="#eq:var_model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:var_model">[eq:var_model]</a> posits a linear
relationship between the current values of stock returns and their
lagged values, along with the lagged returns of the external regressors.
Here, <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> represents a vector
comprising the returns of the stock at time t, while <span
class="math inline">\(X_{1,t-1}, X_{2,t-1}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(X_{3,t-1}\)</span> denote vectors representing the
lagged returns of Gasoline, Lithium Battery, and Chargepoint stocks,
respectively. The coefficient matrices <span class="math inline">\(A_1,
A_2, ..., A_p\)</span> capture the lagged effects of stock returns,
whereas B1, B2, B3 represent the coefficients associated with the lagged
external regressors. The error term <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t\)</span> reflects unobserved factors
influencing stock returns at time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The VAR model offers several
statistical properties essential for comprehensively analyzing the
dynamics of stock returns: Granger Causality VAR models facilitate the
assessment of Granger causality, a fundamental concept in econometrics
that examines whether past values of one variable contain predictive
information about another variable. Impulse Response Function (IRF),
enables researchers to gauge the dynamic response of each variable
within the system to exogenous shocks or innovations. By simulating the
effects of one-time disturbances, IRF analysis elucidates the interplay
between stock returns and the external regressors over time.
Forecasting, Leveraging past observations and estimated coefficients,
VAR models are adept at forecasting future values of stock returns.
These forecasts provide valuable insights for investors and analysts,
aiding in decision-making processes and risk management strategies. In
summary, the VAR model serves as a robust framework for investigating
the intricate relationships between stock returns and external factors,
offering valuable insights into the dynamics of financial markets and
informing strategic decision-making in investment and portfolio
management.</p>
<h1 id="data-and-methodology">Data and Methodology</h1>
<p>I sourced the data for my analysis from Yahoo Finance, comprising
daily stock data from November 30th, 2021, to March 19th, 2024, totaling
578 observations. This timeframe was selected to analyze potential
predictors for Rivian stock, as Rivian went public in November 2021. The
stock data includes battery electric vehicle (BEV) startup companies
Faraday Future, Fisker, Tesla, Rivian, Nio, and Lucid. These companies
exclusively produce BEVs, distinguishing them from traditional
automakers like Volkswagen and Ford, which also manufacture combustion
engine vehicles. By focusing solely on BEV producers, we aim to avoid
potential biases introduced by external factors affecting diversified
automakers. Additionally, I acquired stock data for BEV charger
manufacturers Blink and Chargepoint, anticipating their stock
performance could serve as a robust predictor for BEV startup companies.
Furthermore, I incorporated data on key commodities such as crude oil,
gasoline, and lithium. Crude oil was selected due to its significance in
electricity generation, which is essential for BEVs. Gasoline prices
were included considering their impact on consumer preferences,
potentially influencing the adoption of BEVs. Lastly, lithium, a
critical component in BEV batteries, was examined as fluctuations in its
cost could affect BEV production and subsequently impact stock returns.
After obtaining the stock data of the companies and commodities I then
removed the columns ’symbol’, ’open’, ’high’, ’low’, ’close’, and
’volume’ as these columns are unnecessary for the task. I used the
’Adjusted Close’ column of the data to compute the returns of a stock
using equation <a href="#eq:return" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:return">[eq:return]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{eq:return}
R_t = \frac{p_t - p_{t-1}}{p_{t-1}}\]</span></p>

provide the descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix for the
variables used in this study: Faraday Future(FF), Fisker, Tesla, Rivian,
Nio, Lucid, Blink, Chargepoint, crude oil, gasoline, and lithium.</p>
<h1 id="empirical-data-analysis">Empirical Data Analysis</h1>
<p>In this section, we implement the proposed model and estimation
procedure using empirical data collected from November 30th, 2021, to
March 19th, 2024. Descriptive statistics and correlations of the returns
of BEV stocks are presented in Table 1 of Appendix B. The mean returns
indicate the average daily performance of each stock, with negative
values observed for most companies, suggesting overall negative returns
during the period under review. Variance, skewness, and kurtosis
statistics provide insights into the distribution and volatility of
stock returns, highlighting notable disparities among BEV companies.</p>
<p>Similarly, Table 2 in Appendix B provides descriptive statistics and
correlations for the returns of dependent variables, including crude
oil, gasoline, lithium, and BEV charger manufacturers. The high
correlation coefficients between certain variables, such as crude oil
and gasoline, underscore their interrelatedness and potential impact on
BEV stock returns.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Table 3 and 4 in Appendix B presents the optimal number
of lags to use in the Vector Autoregression (VAR) models for Rivian and
Tesla returns. The selection criteria, including AIC, BIC, and FPE, aid
in determining the most suitable lag structure for the VAR models. These
results inform the specification of the VAR models and contribute to the
accuracy of return forecasts.</p>
<p>Tables 5 and 6 in Appendix B detail the results of the Granger
Causality Tests for Rivian and Tesla returns, respectively. These tests
assess whether past values of one variable contain predictive
information about another variable, providing insights into potential
causal relationships among BEV stocks and external factors. The p-values
associated with each test indicate the significance levels of the causal
relationships, with higher p-values suggesting weaker evidence of
causality.</p>
<p>Table 7 in Appendix B displays the AIC and BIC values for different
GARCH models of Rivian returns. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are widely used measures for
model selection, with lower values indicating better model fit. The
table presents various GARCH specifications, including ARMA(0,0)
GARCH(1,1) and ARMA(1,1) GARCH(2,1), along with their corresponding AIC
and BIC values. These metrics aid in identifying the most appropriate
GARCH model for capturing the volatility dynamics of Rivian returns. The
results provide insights into the effectiveness of different model
specifications in explaining the observed volatility patterns.</p>
<p>Table 8 in Appendix B presents the AIC and BIC values for different
GARCH models of Tesla returns. Similar to Table 7, this table displays
the AIC and BIC values for various GARCH specifications, allowing for
comparisons of model performance. The table includes models such as
ARMA(0,0) GARCH(1,1) and ARMA(1,1) GARCH(2,1), along with their
respective AIC and BIC values. By examining these metrics, researchers
can identify the GARCH model that best captures the volatility dynamics
of Tesla returns. The results offer insights into the suitability of
different model specifications for modeling Tesla’s return
volatility.</p>
<p>Table 9 provides the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values for
forecasts of returns and volatility for both Rivian and Tesla. MAPE is a
commonly used metric for evaluating the accuracy of forecasts, with
lower values indicating higher forecast accuracy. The table presents the
MAPE values for both return and volatility forecasts, offering insights
into the performance of the forecasting models. The observed MAPE values
for Rivian and Tesla provide an assessment of the forecasting accuracy
achieved by the VAR and GARCH models. These results inform researchers
and investors about the reliability of the forecasting models in
predicting future returns and volatility for Rivian and Tesla
stocks.</p>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates the returns of Rivian over time, focusing on the
dates between February 19 and February 26. The forecasted values of
Rivian returns are depicted by the dotted blue line, with the upper and
lower confidence levels shown at a 95% confidence interval. The
highlighted period from February 19 to February 26 in Rivian’s returns
is notable for a significant decline of approximately 30%. Upon closer
examination of the news during that week, it was revealed that this
decline was attributed to disappointing 2024 deliveries and earnings
reported on February 23. The market’s reaction suggests that
expectations were not met, resulting in the observed decrease in
returns. However, the subsequent rebound in returns may indicate that
the initial sell-off reaction was possibly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Figure 2 portrays the returns of Tesla over time, with a focus on the
dates between January 22nd and January 28th. Similarly, the forecasted
values of Tesla returns are represented by the dotted blue line, along
with the upper and lower confidence levels at a 95% confidence interval.
The highlighted period from January 22nd to January 28th in Tesla’s
returns reflects a decline of approximately 12%. Upon reviewing the news
related to Tesla’s returns on January 25th, 2024, it was revealed that
the decrease in returns was attributed to the company reporting earnings
that missed expectations, along with warnings of a slowdown in 2024.
Once again, the subsequent rebound in returns may suggest that the
initial sell-off reaction was potentially exaggerated.</p>
<p>Overall, the empirical data analysis sheds light on the dynamics of
BEV stock returns and their relationships with external factors. The
descriptive statistics, correlations, lag selection criteria, and
Granger Causality Test results collectively contribute to our
understanding of the factors influencing BEV stock performance and
inform the development of forecasting models.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Upon reviewing the results presented in Table 9, it becomes evident
that both the VAR and GARCH models exhibit noticeably high MAPE (Mean
Absolute Percentage Error) values. This suggests that the forecasts
generated by these models may lack accuracy. Furthermore, the observed
high MAPE values indicate a potential lack of explanatory power in the
returns of Gasoline, Lithium Battery, and EV Charger producer stocks.
While the MAPE for the forecast of Rivian appears to be relatively
decent, further research is warranted to ascertain whether this
performance holds consistently over the entire lifetime of the stock.
Additionally, it’s crucial to investigate whether this outcome is an
isolated occurrence, given that the stock exhibited lower volatility
during the forecast period compared to historical data. As of now we
cannot predict the future of the cars of the future. Future research
endeavors should aim to develop a VAR-GARCH model capable of leveraging
stock volatility data to enhance the accuracy of return forecasts.
Additionally, there is a need to refine the forecasting horizon to
shorter periods, such as 1 or 2 days, and evaluate the model’s
performance on a day-to-day basis to assess its precision with a more
focused forecast. Exploring the potential explanatory power of the
number of active EV car chargers in a region could be a valuable avenue
for investigation. This aspect, not fully captured by stock returns
alone, suggests the potential benefits of integrating geospatial data
into the modeling framework. By incorporating real-time data on active
EV chargers, it may be possible to better predict future returns,
considering the influence of infrastructure development on consumer
behavior towards electric vehicles. Exploring the impact of the
implementation of the Federal carbon tax on the returns of an EV startup
stock is of particular interest. Although my analysis was constrained by
the IPO timing of Rivian, focusing solely on stocks that debuted before
the introduction of the Federal carbon tax would allow for a clearer
examination of the policy’s influence on EV stock returns. Additionally,
investigating the effects of the Federal rebate for EV cars presents
another intriguing avenue for research. Given that this incentive
encourages Canadians to purchase EVs, it is reasonable to anticipate a
positive impact on the returns of relevant stocks. Exploring this
relationship further could provide valuable insights into the dynamics
between government policies and EV market performance.<br />
